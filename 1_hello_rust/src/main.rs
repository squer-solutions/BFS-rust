    // Creating and assigning a variable on the stack is done with the let keyword
    // We don't have to specify a type as Rust uses type inference similar but not as
    // powerful as the Hindleyâ€“Milner type system (used in Haskell)

    // Rust uses a best effort approach to infer the type of variables, by default integers are i32
    // and floats are f64
    let x = 1;

    // We can also specify the type of a variable and not initialize it
    let y: i32;

    // We can't use y here because it is not initialized
    // let z = y + 1; // This will not compile

    // And assign it later

    // y = 3; // This will not compile

    // Numeric operations are done with the usual operators

    // Logically the old x is still in scope, but lexically it impossible to access it
    let x = 22;
    println!("The value of the new x is: {}", x); // Will print 22

    // We can create arbitrary scopes

        let x = 3;
